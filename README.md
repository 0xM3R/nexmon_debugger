# Nexmon Debugger

To analyze the FullMAC firmware running on the ARM microcontroller in the BCM4339 Wi-Fi chip,
we created a debugger in software that directly accesses the hardware registers of the ARM
Debugging core. As we do not have access to the JTAG port, we generate exceptions whenever a
breakpoint or watchpoint is triggered. We handle those exceptions in our firmware patch and
can then continue with the execution of the firmware code.

In our example, we set a breakpoint at the `printf` function:
```
dbg_set_breakpoint_for_addr_match(0, 0x126f0); // trigger on printf
```
When it triggers, the function `handle_pref_abort_exception` is called. There, we check if 
register `R1` points to the string `sdpcmd_dpc`. If the condition matches, we print a debug 
message and activate single-step debugging. To this end, we set the breakpoint to trigger on
a mismatch of the address of the current program counter. Then we can decide to either trigger 
on a mismatch of the current program counter address again for single stepping or reset the 
breakpoint to the original address of the `printf` funciton.

Additionally, we set a memory watchpoint on the address of the string 
`%s: Broadcom SDPCMD CDC driver`:
```
dbg_set_watchpoint_for_addr_match(0, 0x1FC2A4); // trigger on "%s: Broadcom SDPCMD CDC driver" string
```
Whenever, code reads or writes to this address, a data abort exception is triggered that is
handled by the `handle_data_abort_exception` function. In this function, we print the address
of the instruction accessing monitored memory location. We also disable the watchpoint and set
a new breakpoint to trigger on an address mismatch of the current program counter to advance 
by one instruction. The breakpoint handler reactivates the watchpoint.

The output observed on the console is as follows:
```
start=0x001eb5d8 len=0x00000800

`0x12b3a` is an instruction in the `vsnprintf` function called during the `printf` call writing to 
the chip's console. `0x126c2` is an instruction in the `memset` function, called after initialization
when parts of the code used during initialization is freed and assigned to the heap.

# Getting Started

To compile the source code, you are required to first checkout a copy of the original nexmon
repository that contains our C-based patching framework for Wi-Fi firmwares. That you checkout
this repository as one of the sub-projects in the corresponding patches sub-directory. This 
allows you to build and compile all the firmware patches required to repeat our experiments.
The following steps will get you started on Xubuntu 16.04 LTS:

1. Install some dependencies: `sudo apt-get install git gawk qpdf adb`
2. **Only necessary for x86_64 systems**, install i386 libs: 

  ```
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
  ```
3. Clone the nexmon base repository: `git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git`.
4. Download and extract Android NDK r11c (use exactly this version!).
5. Export the NDK_ROOT environment variable pointing to the location where you extracted the ndk so that it can be found by our build environment.
6. Navigate to the previously cloned nexmon directory and execute `source setup_env.sh` to set a couple of environment variables.
7. Run `make` to extract ucode, templateram and flashpatches from the original firmwares.
8. Navigate to utilities and run `make` to build all utilities such as nexmon.
9. Attach your rooted Nexus 5 smartphone running stock firmware version 6.0.1 (M4B30Z, Dec 2016).
10. Run `make install` to install all the built utilities on your phone.
11. Navigate to patches/bcm4339/6_37_34_43/ and clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/wintech2017_nexmon_ping_offloading.git`
12. Enter the created subdirectory wisec2017_nexmon_jammer and run `make install-firmware` to compile our firmware patch and install it on the attached Nexus 5 smartphone.
